# Assignment 8

###This is a sketch of what I want my final project to be like. 

**TOPIC: Incarceration is tied to poverty and ethnicity in the US**

Based on the following article: http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/streeracpripov.html

And stylistically inspired on this article: [Motorcycle Deaths] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/31/science/motorcycle-helmet-laws.html?_r=1)

I would like to visualize the following:
- Incarceration rates increase after 1975 and until now. Visual reference:

- Comparison of the incarceration rates in the US vs. other countries. Based on: The U.S. incarcerates its citizens at a rate six times higher than Canada, England, and France, seven times higher than Switzerland and Holland, and ten times Sweden and Finland. Visual reference:
